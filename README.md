# snail
JaydenDev's bash software builder
# Why snail?
The only reason to use this builder, is if you code in bash and like to keep all your functions in seperate files.
# Why's it called snail?
shell, snail... get it?
# This builder is 100% efficient and fast!
That's precisely why you should be using it in *ALL* your **bash** *projects*
